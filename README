This program will "keep watch" over the downloads folder and move any incomming files to categorized folders. I.E. a downloaded pdf file will be sent to the pdf folder that is created in the myDocuments folder.

To use this program, download the following files and use Python 3:
1. DownloadCleanup.service
2. Download_Cleanup
3. Use python 3 and in the termnial (cntrl + alt + t) and input: "pip install watchdog" (This is a necessary python package for the script)

If you would like to have the category folders automatically created, open the terminal (cntrl + alt + t) and run the following command in your terminal:

Recommended:
mkdir Documents/{PDF_Files, Deb_Files, Image_Files, Text_Files, Spreadsheet_Files, Random_Files}

Abstract:
mkdir <Parent Folder>/{<folder>,<folder>...<folder>}

If you would like this program to run as a service at startup:

Place the DownloadCleanup.service folder in your system folder. To get to system open terminal (cntrl + alt + t) and enter the following command:

Automatically:

Download the file and move it using mv:
1. open terminal (cntrl + alt + t) and input "cd Downloads"
2. input "mv DownloadCleanup.serice" /etc/systemd/system/

Finally:

Download and move the DownloadCleanup file to a permanent location (I recommend a folder in your documents folder)

open terminal (cntrl + alt + t)
mkdir Documents/DownloadCleanupScript
cd Downloads
mv DownloadCleanup /home/<user>/Documents/DownloadCleanupScript

once you have moved the filed, navigate back to the system folder:

cd /etc/systemd/system

edit the service script

sudo nano DownloadCleaup.service

Change the user to your user
User=<user>

Change the ExecStart to your directory that you put the script in

ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /<directory of script>/DownloadCleanup

To add further categorizing directories:

1. Add another elif statement

            elif filename.endswith(('.FileTpye'....'.FileType')):
                src = folder_to_track + "/" + filename
                new_destination_name = destination_name + "/" + filename
                os.rename(src, new_destination_name)
                
                
2. Add another destination name above the others at the bottom of the script:

new_destination = "/home/greg/Documents/new_folder"
