This program will take all files in the download directory (Change as needed) and categorize them into subfolders. In its current
state, the program will need to be initialized first, then the files will need to be added into the downloads folder for them to be
categorized. 

Future developments: write an rc.local file that will initialize the script on startup so it is always watching for changes in the 
directory. This will negate the need to run the script and then put the files in the download file.
